# Overview

This software will allow you to write out tasks that you need completed and keep track of them for you. I was mainly doing this because I always have problems remembering different things I want to do during the day or week and wanted something I could reference.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Community for my IDE which made coding in C++ possible without having to install anything extra or I would use VS Code. It provided me with the proper running and debugging software to check for any issues that arrose during the process and allowed me to run my code to check for functionality.

# Useful Websites

For my json data using C++ I went with nlohmann because it offered easy access, writing, and saving to a json as json data.

# Future Work

* Add dates for the tasks to allow for certain days showing.
* Make the json save to the file so it is not wiped on restart.
* Make it so the user can name the id as well as the task.
